So first some news-  today I've received a [reprap pro ormerod 2 3d printer kit](https://reprappro.com/shop/reprap-kits/ormerod-2-kit/)! I will be assembling it over the coming few days or weeks, and it is not something I will rush! As for the cnc - until I sort out a better dust control system for milling foam and MDF it is currently not doing a lot.

While following the assembly instructions for this kit, at the earliest part, it has a click through to the stl file in github. What I did not know is that github has a built in STL view! Absolutely awesome. Github continues to surprise and delight me. Perhaps I should (if I ever have time) try to contribute a Lego LDraw viewer to github.
